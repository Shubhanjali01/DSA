## Algorithm
1. Start

2. Input: number of rows n (for this example, n = 4)
3. For each row i from 1 to n:

4. Print increasing numbers from 1 to i
5. Calculate number of spaces: spaces = 2 * (n - i)

6. Print spaces number of spaces
7. Print decreasing numbers from i to 1
8. Move to next line

9. End.
